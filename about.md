<h2>The Author</h2>

I am an InfoSec Consultant by profession and have been in the industry for a few years now. However, I feel that there is still a lot more to learn and improve on if I wish to be a real hacker and master of my field. Thus, I am considering myself a Warrior in Training, constantly learning and fighting to improve myself everyday. And as I learn, i wish to share my learnings with everyone who needs it.

It is said that **to be become a master, you must first become an apprentice**. My goal is to help people on their journey to becoming masters in their field and masters of their life.
